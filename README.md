What if your text editor use hexagonal tiling? And design programming language around it? Imagine seeing this beautiful grid in front of you and the joy that it will bring to your programming experience.

## Goals

- Hexagonal tiling
- Full esolang expirience
- [Seximal](https://www.seximal.net/) (base 6) as default (and only) number system.
- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) as default color scheme

## Will it still be editor or just esolang / IDE?

Emacs is called an editor, beeing an Operating System, so anything goes I guess
